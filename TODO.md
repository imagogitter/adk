# TODO List for Autonomous Trading Platform

## Phase 0: Setup & Foundation
- [x] Initialize Git repository and set up branching strategy.
- [x] Finalize coding standards and linter setup (e.g., flake8, mypy) for Python 3.13.
- [x] Create `.env.example` and `.env.gcp.example` in `/secrets`.
- [ ] Test Docker Compose setup.
- [x] Document InfluxDB initial setup steps (Org, Bucket, Token).

## Phase 1: Data Pipeline & Storage
- [ ] Implement `data_pipeline.py` with ccxt OHLCV fetching and InfluxDB writing.
- [ ] Define InfluxDB schema (measurement, tags, fields).
- [ ] Test data pipeline with historical data load (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT).
- [ ] Add error handling and logging to data pipeline.

## Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- [ ] Select initial technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
- [ ] Implement `feature_engineering.py` with pandas-ta.
- [ ] Test feature calculation on historical data.
- [ ] Optimize feature computation for large datasets.

## Phase 3: ADK Agent Core Development
- [ ] Complete ADK learning and setup Google Cloud credentials.
- [ ] Implement `DatabaseTool` and `CCXTInfoTool`.
- [ ] Develop initial ADK agent with simple decision logic.
- [ ] Test agent tools in isolation.

## Phase 4: Backtesting Integration
- [ ] Create custom Backtrader data feed for InfluxDB.
- [ ] Implement ADK-Backtrader strategy integration.
- [ ] Add commission and slippage to backtests.
- [ ] Generate initial backtest reports with quantstats.

## Phase 5: Agent Enhancement & Optimization
- [ ] Enhance ADK agent with complex logic (e.g., LLM, risk management).
- [ ] Implement Optuna HPO script for agent parameters.
- [ ] Run HPO study and select best agent configuration.
- [ ] Validate best agent with extended backtest.

## Phase 6: Live Agent Implementation
- [ ] Implement `CCXTExecutionTool` and `RiskManagementTool`.
- [ ] Add state persistence for live agent.
- [ ] Develop internal Flask API for agent control.
- [ ] Run paper trading on Binance.us Testnet.

## Phase 7: Web Interface
- [ ] Design Dash layout with graphs, tables, and controls.
- [ ] Implement database queries for trade history and P&L.
- [ ] Add callbacks for real-time UI updates.
- [ ] Test UI with paper trading data.

## Phase 8: Integration Testing & Paper Trading Analysis
- [ ] Conduct full-stack integration tests.
- [ ] Run extended paper trading and compare with backtest results.
- [ ] Fix bugs and refine agent/tools based on paper trading.

## Phase 9: Deployment & Battle-Hardening
- [ ] Set up production server with Docker and firewall.
- [ ] Deploy with production `.env` files and real API keys.
- [ ] Start limited live trading with small capital.
- [ ] Monitor live performance and iterate on agent logic.
